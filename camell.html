 <h1>Camelids</h1>
<p>The four llamas and two camels are camelids tend too be large and are strictly behaviourous.Camelids differ from
 ruminants in several ways. they have a three chambered rather than the four chambereddigestive tract; an upper lip 
that is split in two with each part seperately mobile , and an isolated incisor in the upper jaw. they have long legs that,
because they lacktensor skin to bridge between thigh and body, look longer still (from wikipedia)</p>
